# Plant_Disease_Classification
# Introduction

Plant growth can be affected by many types of diseases which directly leads to effect the crop production and that affect the supply chain in food industry. We have a lot of option to decrease the plant dieseas but we need to take that option which is most efficient in both time and money.

With the help of deep learning technologies we can reduced the time of searching which plant's leaves are diseased or healthy. It's a typical classification problem that can be solved using many of the deep learning algorithm such as DNN, CNN, or other machine learning algorithms.

In this project we are using CNN to classify which plant leaves are healthy and which one is not. Moreover we are using state of art transfer learning techniques such as VGG16 to get highly accurate model that precisiely classify the image.
